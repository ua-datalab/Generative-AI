      "have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\n",
      "nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\n",
      "spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\n",

      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\n",

      "Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\n",
      "in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\n",
      "sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\n",
      "possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\n",

      "Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\n",
      "was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\n",

      "\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\n",
      "strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\n",
      "country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\n",

      "something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\n",
      "didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\n",
      "look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\n",
      "Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\n",
      "of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\n",
      "stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\n",
      "corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\n",
      "reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\n",
      "put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of\n",
      "nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\n",
      "noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\n",
      "about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\n",
      "funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\n",
      "was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\n",
      "wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\n",
      "close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\n",
      "enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\n",
      "had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\n",
      "silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\n",
      "yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\n",
      "Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate\n",
      "on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad\n",
      "daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed\n",
      "open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never\n",
      "seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\n",
      "normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\n",
      "several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\n",
      "very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs\n",
      "and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't\n",
      "know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\n",
      "excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\n",
      "his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he\n",
      "caught a few words of what they were saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better\n",
      "of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\n",
      "finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the\n",
      "receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was\n",
      "being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were\n",
      "lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\n",
      "of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even\n",
      "seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point\n",
      "in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\n",
      "sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all\n",
      "the same, those people in cloaks...\n",
      "\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\n",
      "when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that\n",
      "he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\n",
      "was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\n",
      "violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\n",
      "ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\n",
      "a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir,\n",
      "for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at\n",
      "last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,\n",
      "happy day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that\n",
      "was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping\n",
      "he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he\n",
      "didn't approve of imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that\n",
      "morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\n",
      "same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a\n",
      "stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying\n",
      "to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still\n",
      "determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When\n",
      "Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to\n",
      "catch the last report on the evening news:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally\n",
      "hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been\n",
      "hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\n",
      "sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\n",
      "changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\n",
      "\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going\n",
      "to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as\n",
      "Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\n",
      "of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting\n",
      "stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's\n",
      "not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?\n",
      "And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat\n",
      "nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister\n",
      "lately, have you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",

      "\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\n",
      "know... her crowd.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he\n",
      "didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son --\n",
      "he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n",

      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",

      "It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of\n",
      "-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting\n",
      "thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\n",
      "involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\n",
      "them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get\n",

      "-- it couldn't affect them....\n",
      "\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\n",
      "on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as\n",
      "still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\n",
      "Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the\n",
      "next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly\n",
      "midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the\n",
      "ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which\n",
      "were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,\n",
      "a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.\n",
      "His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon\n",
      "spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been\n",
      "broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to\n",
      "realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,\n",
      "which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\n",
      "some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and\n",
      "muttered, \"I should have known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\n",
      "clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\n",
      "clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\n",
      "he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\n",
      "were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\n",
      "watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening\n",
      "down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his\n",
      "cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down\n",
      "on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\n",
      "at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\n",
      "the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was\n",
      "wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight\n",
      "bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\n",

      "tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands\n",
      "the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were\n",

      "\"No problems, were there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\n",

      "shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\n",

      "\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his\n",
      "great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\n",
      "scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a\n",
      "wounded dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you'll wake the Muggles!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\n",
      "we'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly\n",
      "on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\n",
      "the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\n",
      "of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to\n",
      "the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at\n",
      "the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall\n",
      "blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from\n",
      "Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\n",

      "here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his\n",

      "\n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\n",
      "onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose\n",
      "into the air and off into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore,\n",
      "nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\n",
      "stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\n",
      "twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\n",
      "Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking\n",
      "around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the\n",

      "blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside\n",
      "him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\n",
      "famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\n",

      "usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was\n",
      "sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\n",

      "were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall\n",
      "back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo\n",
      "restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\n",
      "glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\n",

      "stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,\n",
      "man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\n",

      "with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n",
      "\n",

      "wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no\n",
      "company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying\n",
      "to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a\n",

      "to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It winked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\n",

      "\n",
      "The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\n",

      "\"I get that all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the\n",

      "\n",
      "The snake nodded vigorously.\n",
      "\n",

      "so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were\n",
      "leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with\n",
      "howls of horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank\n",
      "had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\n",
      "out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and\n",
      "started running for the exits.\n",
      "\n",

      "snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\n",
      "all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had\n",
      "nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\n",

      "hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding\n",

      "supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green\n",
      "light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and\n",

      "broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working\n",

      "that letter than up here without it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\n",

      "sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He\n",
      "shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make\n",
      "a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\n",
      "time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\n",
      "Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\n",
      "out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\n",
      "back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"\n",
      "as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\n",
      "Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\n",
      "of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\n",
      "Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious\n",

      "amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\n",
      "tired and rather ill, but happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade\n",
      "on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\n",

      "Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\n",
      "him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty\n",
      "letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\n",
      "ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Out! OUT!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\n",
      "When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\n",

      "still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\n",
      "great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back\n",
      "here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some\n",
      "clothes. No arguments!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\n",
      "argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the\n",
      "boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.\n",
      "Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the\n",
      "head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\n",
      "computer in his sports bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they\n",
      "were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\n",
      "drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake'em off... shake 'em\n",
      "off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was\n",
      "howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd\n",
      "missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone\n",
      "so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\n",
      "outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds\n",
      "and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on\n",

      "wondering....\n",
      "\n",
      "They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\n",

      "\n",
      "Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\n",
      "timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly\n",
      "what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the\n",
      "middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in\n",
      "the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle\n",

      "a multilevel parking garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\n",
      "afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside\n",
      "the car, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\n",
      "sniveled.\n",
      "\n",

      "Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you\n",
      "could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\n",
      "television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of\n",
      "course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\n",
      "had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\n",
      "Still, you weren't eleven every day.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\n",
      "looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was\n",
      "the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was\n",
      "certain, there was no television in there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\n",

      "\n",
      "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\n",

      "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\n",
      "necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like\n",
      "hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,\n",
      "led the way to the broken-down house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\n",
      "whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was\n",
      "damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\n",

      "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\n",
      "of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately\n",
      "agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\n",
      "high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the\n",
      "filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\n",
      "room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle\n",
      "Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\n",
      "the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\n",
      "most ragged blanket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\n",
      "couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,\n",
      "his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the\n",
      "low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of\n",
      "Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\n",
      "wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and\n",

      "Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of\n",
      "letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\n",
      "that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was\n",
      "the rock crumbling into the sea?\n",
      "\n",
      "One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\n",

      "\n",
      "BOOM.\n",

      "chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\n",
      "before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and\n",
      "smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was\n",
      "working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt\n",
      "sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\n",

      "\n",

      "hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it\n",
      "could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of\n",
      "ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\n",
      "beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and\n",
      "broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had\n",

      "coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.\n",
      "There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more\n",
      "goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have his key, Sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\n",
      "pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\n",
      "over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry\n",
      "watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as\n",

      "\n",
      "The goblin read the letter carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone\n",
      "take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts\n",
      "business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh\n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\n",
      "marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with\n",
      "flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little\n",
      "railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came\n",
      "hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some\n",
      "difficulty -- and were off.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry\n",
      "tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,\n",
      "but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,\n",
      "because Griphook wasn't steering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\n",
      "wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a\n",
      "passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -\n",
      "they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge\n",
      "stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\n",
      "\"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions\n",
      "just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\n",
      "door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the\n",
      "wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and\n",
      "as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns\n",
      "of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about\n",
      "this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\n",
      "they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there\n",
      "had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to\n",
      "a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,\n",
      "that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe\n",
      "for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,\n",
      "please, and can we go more slowly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\n",
      "colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went\n",
      "rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to\n",
      "try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and\n",
      "pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with\n",
      "one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through\n",
      "the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\n",
      "Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous\n",
      "jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then\n",
      "he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on\n",
      "the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry\n",
      "longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way\n",
      "back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\n",
      "Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag\n",
      "full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a\n",
      "pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole\n",
      "life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\n",
      "Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I\n",
      "slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them\n",
      "Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam\n",
      "Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot\n",
      "here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on\n",
      "a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam\n",
      "Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his\n",
      "head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street\n",
      "looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then\n",
      "I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why\n",
      "first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting\n",
      "me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.\n",

      "\"No,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Play Quidditch at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my\n",
      "house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know\n",
      "I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in\n",
      "Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing\n",
      "he could say something a bit more interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the\n",
      "front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing\n",
      "at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.\n",
      "\"He works at Hogwarts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't\n",
      "he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\n",
      "every second.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\n",

      "and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where\n",
      "are your parents?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into\n",
      "the matter with this boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were\n",
      "our kind, weren't they?\"\n",

      "\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're\n",
      "just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some\n",
      "of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,\n",
      "imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.\n",
      "What's your surname, anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my\n",
      "dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,\n",
      "hopped down from the footstool.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\n",
      "(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's up?\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\n",
      "cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\n",

      "about Quidditch!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "he had gone -- but how had he done it?\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\n",

      "--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\n",

      "you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\n",
      "solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to\n",
      "platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash\n",
      "right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward\n",
      "on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer\n",
      "and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control\n",
      "-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet\n",

      "overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him\n",
      "and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the\n",
      "words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\n",
      "while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls\n",
      "hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and\n",
      "the scraping of heavy trunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\n",
      "out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment\n",
      "near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started\n",
      "to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it\n",
      "up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it\n",
      "painfully on his foot.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\"He's coming now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\n",

      "on his chest with the letter P on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the\n",

      "\"Or twice --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A minute --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All summer --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear,\n",
      "well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl\n",

      "A whistle sounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\n",
      "corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of\n",
      "excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better\n",
      "than what he was leaving behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\n",

      "\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\n",
      "George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\n",

      "interesting as Ron found him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\n",

      "though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth\n",
      "in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up\n",
      "to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie\n",

      "around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks\n",
      "they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\n",
      "but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get\n",
      "anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,\n",
      "Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "went back to staring out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to\n",

      "month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old\n",
      "clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer\n",
      "Ron up.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\n",

      "\n",
      "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he\n",
      "had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\n",

      "Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice\n",
      "Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\n",

      "the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Hungry, are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\n",

      "\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share\n",
      "before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,\n",
      "sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,\n",
      "cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n",

      "nothing would surprise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\"\n",

      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\n",
      "man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and\n",

      "name Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n",

      "gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than\n",
      "looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep\n",

      "ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then\n",
      "you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-\n",

      "\n",
      "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\n",
      "coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was\n",

      "touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat\n",

      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy\n",

      "the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw\n",
      "wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's\n",

      "Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you\n",

      "\"Really? What happened to them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My\n",

      "You-Know-Who's behind it.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this\n",
      "was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more\n",
      "comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er -- I don't know any,\" Harry confessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the\n",
      "world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\n",
      "positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to\n",
      "with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the\n",
      "money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\n",
      "when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the\n",
      "toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\n",
      "the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with\n",
      "a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry\n",
      "Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\n",
      "thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale\n",
      "boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\n",
      "noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco\n",
      "Malfoy looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father\n",
      "told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\n",
      "they can afford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families\n",
      "are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends\n",
      "with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said\n",
      "coolly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a\n",
      "bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know\n",
      "what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\n",
      "Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Harry and Ron stood up.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\n",
      "Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food\n",

      "horrible yell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk\n",
      "deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\n",
      "Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off\n",
      "and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they\n",
      "thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd\n",
      "heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the\n",
      "floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\n",

      "they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the\n",

      "been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving\n",
      "very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a\n",
      "sniffy voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you\n",
      "know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\n",
      "getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple\n",
      "sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\n",

      "to the school separately.\"\n",

      "Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\n",

      "joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way\n",
      "toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in\n",
      "the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the\n",
      "students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs' years! Firs' years\n",
      "over here! All right there, Harry?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\n",
      "steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry\n",
      "thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the\n",
      "boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over\n",
      "his shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a loud \"Oooooh!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.\n",
      "Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\n",
      "the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\n",
      "boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed\n",
      "into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid,\n",
      "who had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the\n",
      "lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at\n",
      "the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer\n",
      "and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they\n",
      "all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\n",
      "of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried\n",
      "along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the\n",
      "castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they\n",
      "clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the\n",
      "boats as people climbed out of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\n",
      "clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at\n",
      "last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak\n",

      "to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\n",
      "He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\n",
      "too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering\n",
      "very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one\n",
      "she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more\n",
      "nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to\n",
      "the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He\n",

      "at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\n",

      "\n",
      "A few people nodded mutely.\n",

      "into the Great Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\n",
      "lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\n",
      "over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\n",
      "These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the\n",
      "top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a\n",
      "halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.\n",
      "The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\n",
      "flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the\n",
      "ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry\n",
      "looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He\n",
      "heard\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\n",
      "a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she\n",
      "put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\n",
      "extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\n",
      "that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was\n",
      "now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there\n",
      "was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened\n",
      "wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\n",

      "\n",
      "Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty\n",

      "Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\n",
      "he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,\n",
      "horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\n",

      "He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\n",

      "sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd\n",
      "gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair\n",
      "was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the\n",
      "ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man\n",
      "from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\n",

      "he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\n",
      "food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:\n",
      "roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon\n",
      "and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,\n",
      "peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint\n",

      "\n",
      "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been\n",
      "allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything\n",
      "that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his\n",
      "plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.\n",
      "It was all delicious.\n",

      "\n",
      "I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't\n",

      "going at all the way he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His\n",
      "whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on\n",
      "a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\n",
      "properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly\n",
      "Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\n",

      "When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\n",
      "faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment\n",
      "later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you\n",

      "dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\n",
      "when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let\n",

      "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\n",
      "looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the\n",
      "doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,\n",
      "without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped\n",
      "through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled\n",
      "along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was\n",
      "miles from the trophy room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall\n",

      "for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they\n",
      "hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible\n",
      "between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they\n",
      "reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their\n",
      "bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the\n",
      "portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and\n",
      "collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\n",
      "as if he'd never speak again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up\n",
      "in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one\n",
      "does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You\n",
      "don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see\n",
      "what it was standing on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too\n",
      "busy with its heads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously\n",
      "guarding something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood up, glaring at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --\n",
      "or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron stared after her, his mouth open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along,\n",
      "wouldn't you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\n",
      "back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?\n",
      "Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\n",
      "hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\n",

      "Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\n",
      "still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\n",
      "Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the\n",
      "three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite\n",
      "keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the\n",
      "package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and\n",
      "they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\n",
      "protection. \"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"Or both,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\n",
      "was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what\n",
      "it was without further clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\n",
      "underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never\n",

      "\n",
      "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a\n",
      "bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really\n",
      "wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great\n",
      "delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\n",
      "was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech\n",
      "owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\n",
      "this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\n",
      "it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had\n",

      "of the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n",

      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody\n",

      "before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they\n",

      "package from Harry and felt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\n",
      "of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time,\n",
      "Potter, first years aren't allowed them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron couldn't resist it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.\n",
      "What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron\n",
      "grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same\n",
      "league as the Nimbus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the\n",

      "save up twig by twig.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.\n",

      "\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\n",
      "\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\n",
      "look of horror on Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here\n",
      "that I've got it,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's\n",
      "obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they\n",

      "Remembrall I wouln't be on the team....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an\n",
      "angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\n",
      "looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\n",
      "kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\n",
      "under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be\n",
      "learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without\n",
      "noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\n",
      "the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\n",
      "looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long\n",
      "tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\n",
      "near the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\n",
      "dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium\n",
      "before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\n",
      "the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end\n",
      "of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They\n",
      "reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\n",
      "\n",
      "children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\n",
      "and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\n",
      "of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two\n",
      "Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey, Potter, come down!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\n",
      "arm. Harry landed next to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\n",
      "meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules\n",
      "this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\n",
      "if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\n",
      "Three of them are called Chasers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\n",
      "about the size of a soccer ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\n",
      "Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\n",
      "score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\n",
      "hoops. Follow me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\"\n",
      "Harry recited. \"So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with\n",
      "six hoops, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry\n",
      "quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm\n",
      "Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other\n",
      "team from scoring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember\n",
      "it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n",
      "they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are\n",
      "the Bludgers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\n",
      "the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\n",
      "escape the straps holding them inside the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\n",
      "Bludgers.\n",
      "\n",
      "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\n",
      "Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\n",
      "his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around\n",
      "their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to\n",
      "pin it to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\n",
      "and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to\n",
      "knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each\n",
      "team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their\n",
      "side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\n",
      "-- think you've got all that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\n",
      "goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry\n",
      "reeled off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\n",
      "sounded offhand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\n",
      "than that. Now, the last member of the team is the\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the\n",
      "Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I\n",
      "mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\n",
      "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size\n",
      "of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\n",
      "wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important\n",
      "ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and\n",
      "difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave\n",
      "in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it\n",
      "before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the\n",
      "Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\n",
      "\n",
      "nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\n",
      "Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n",
      "-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on\n",
      "substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that's it -- any\n",
      "questions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\n",
      "doing it that was going to be the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting\n",
      "it back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try\n",
      "you out with a few of these.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\n",
      "minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf\n",
      "balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\n",
      "hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily\n",
      "as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you\n",
      "turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for\n",
      "England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\n",
      "three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\n",
      "believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two\n",
      "months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His\n",
      "lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\n",
      "mastered the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\n",
      "wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\n",
      "in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\n",
      "something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make\n",
      "Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\n",
      "class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which\n",
      "was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,\n",
      "however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell\n",
      "whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to\n",
      "either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\"\n",
      "squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as\n",
      "usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic\n",
      "words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,\n",
      "who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a\n",
      "buffalo on his chest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\n",
      "feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\n",
      "desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and\n",
      "set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\n",

      "heads.\n",

      "Miss Granger's done it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It's no wonder no\n",

      "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\n",

      "\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe\n",
      "Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\n",
      "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\n",
      "suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've just thought -- Hermione.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She doesn't know about the troll.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron bit his lip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\n",
      "down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'\n",
      "bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick\n",
      "footsteps behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\n",
      "corridor and disappeared from view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the dungeons\n",
      "with the rest of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Search me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's\n",
      "fading footsteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you smell something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\n",
      "socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\n",
      "gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,\n",
      "something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and\n",
      "watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite\n",
      "gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\n",
      "perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks\n",
      "with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was\n",
      "holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its\n",
      "arms were so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its\n",
      "long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\n",
      "\n",
      "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't\n",
      "about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the\n",
      "key, slam the door, and lock it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but\n",
      "as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts\n",
      "stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber\n",
      "they'd just chained up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hermione!\" they said together.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n",
      "Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,\n",
      "fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\n",
      "she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the\n",
      "sinks off the walls as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he\n",
      "threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\n",
      "stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw\n",
      "Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it\n",
      "went.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\n",
      "threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe\n",
      "hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning\n",
      "its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\n",
      "the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,\n",
      "her mouth open with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\n",
      "roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\n",
      "took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the\n",
      "troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,\n",
      "but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\n",
      "nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it\n",
      "had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\n",
      "\n",
      "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\n",
      "clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him\n",
      "off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --\n",
      "not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell\n",
      "that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into\n",
      "the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto\n",
      "its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its\n",
      "face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\n",
      "standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Hermione who spoke first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it -- dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think so,\" said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered\n",
      "in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He wiped it on the troll's trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\n",
      "They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\n",
      "someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A\n",
      "moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,\n",
      "closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell\n",
      "took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly\n",
      "down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\n",
      "Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.\n",
      "Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with\n",
      "cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with\n",
      "his wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in\n",
      "your dormitory?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\n",
      "wished Ron would put his wand down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a small voice came out of the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Granger!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it\n",
      "on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\n",
      "teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand\n",
      "up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have\n",
      "time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they\n",
      "arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the\n",
      "three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of\n",
      "tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\n",
      "person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending\n",
      "she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started\n",
      "handing out sweets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt\n",
      "at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing\n",
      "the feast in their houses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\n",
      "taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five\n",
      "points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had\n",
      "climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the\n",
      "troll, quite apart from anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind\n",
      "you, we did save her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with\n",
      "her,\" Harry reminded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that\n",
      "had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting\n",
      "for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking\n",
      "at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are\n",

      "\n",
      "As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\n",
      "around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every\n",
      "morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the\n",
      "upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled\n",
      "up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous\n",
      "beaverskin boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in\n",
      "his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\n",
      "Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house\n",
      "championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\n",
      "their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news\n",
      "that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know\n",
      "which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people\n",
      "telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't\n",
      "know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what\n",
      "with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She\n",
      "had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a\n",
      "very interesting read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\n",
      "Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\n",
      "match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\n",
      "players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\n",
      "them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had\n",
      "been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\n",
      "and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\n",
      "for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them\n",
      "were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured\n",
      "them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\n",
      "They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape\n",
      "crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,\n",
      "Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;\n",
      "they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about\n",
      "their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen\n",

      "anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that you've got there, Potter?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "away. \"Wonder what's wrong with his leg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\n",
      "Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\n",
      "Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will\n",
      "you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right\n",
      "answers anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\n",
      "his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of\n",

      "he could have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\n",

      "\n",
      "He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.\n",
      "He knocked again. Nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\n",
      "the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop\n",
      "it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We\n",
      "must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him\n",
      "anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left\n",
      "Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid\n",
      "had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\n",
      "was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to\n",
      "begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\n",
      "book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable\n",
      "Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern\n",
      "Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And\n",
      "then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of\n",
      "thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\n",
      "search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them\n",
      "off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\n",
      "Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in\n",
      "there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the\n",
      "teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never\n",
      "get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never\n",
      "taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced\n",
      "Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left\n",
      "the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not\n",
      "ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be\n",
      "able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were\n",
      "up to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\n",
      "anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two\n",
      "weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\n",
      "wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a\n",
      "nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\n",
      "They went off to lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And\n",
      "send me an owl if you find anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"It'd be safe to ask them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time\n",
      "to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\n",
      "common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the\n",
      "good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they\n",
      "could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows\n",
      "-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk\n",
      "about even if they wouldn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\n",
      "Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot\n",
      "like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.\n",
      "Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in\n",
      "his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen\n",
      "weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\n",
      "getting them to do what he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't\n",
      "trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept\n",
      "shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don't\n",
      "send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose\n",
      "him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\n",
      "day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.\n",
      "When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\n",
      "small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\n",
      "pulled on his bathrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\n",
      "was a lot bigger than Harry's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\n",
      "scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut\n",
      "wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --\n",
      "it sounded a bit like an owl.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second, very small parcel contained a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle\n",
      "Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Weird!\" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\n",
      "and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\n",
      "pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect\n",
      "any presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley\n",
      "sweater.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\n",
      "emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and\n",
      "mine's always maroon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was\n",
      "very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs\n",
      "from Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very\n",
      "light. He unwrapped it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\n",
      "lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\n",
      "Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it\n",
      "is -- they're really rare, and really valuable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to\n",
      "the touch, like water woven into material.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm\n",
      "sure it is -- try it on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is! Look down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\n",
      "mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head\n",
      "suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak\n",
      "over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,\n",
      "loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your\n",
      "father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was\n",
      "returned to you. Use it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\n",
      "cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the\n",
      "matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\n",
      "it really once belonged to his father?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\n",
      "open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak\n",
      "quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else\n",
      "yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on\n",
      "it, the other a G.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's\n",
      "sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it\n",
      "on, they're lovely and warm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she\n",
      "thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're\n",
      "called Gred and Forge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's all th is noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\n",
      "had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,\n",
      "carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred seized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even\n",
      "Harry got one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater\n",
      "over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said\n",
      "\n",
      "George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\n",
      "his sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred\n",
      "fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of\n",
      "chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy\n",
      "and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet\n",
      "along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\n",
      "feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\n",
      "plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\n",
      "cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like\n",
      "a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\n",
      "inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at\n",
      "the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a\n",
      "flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\n",
      "had just read him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\n",
      "teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid\n",
      "getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,\n",
      "finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's\n",
      "amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\n",
      "things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\n",
      "balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.\n",
      "The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\n",
      "going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\n",
      "fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\n",
      "returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in\n",
      "his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he\n",
      "wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\n",
      "everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and\n",
      "watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because\n",
      "they'd stolen his prefect badge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\n",
      "nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed\n",
      "was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had\n",
      "sent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\n",
      "fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his\n",
      "four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\n",
      "cloak out from under it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow\n",
      "over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note\n",
      "had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\n",
      "around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and\n",
      "shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\n",
      "in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the\n",
      "dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch\n",
      "would never know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\n",
      "-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he\n",
      "wanted to use it alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\n",
      "and climbed through the portrait hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\n",
      "quickly down the corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\n",
      "it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to\n",
      "read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\n",
      "He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\n",
      "walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\n",
      "way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along\n",
      "in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the\n",
      "sight gave him the creeps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping\n",
      "carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\n",
      "library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\n",
      "words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.\n",
      "One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\n",
      "hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,\n",
      "maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,\n",
      "as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\n",
      "he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large\n",
      "black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with\n",
      "difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,\n",
      "let it fall open.\n",
      "\n",
      "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\n",
      "screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one\n",
      "high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over\n",
      "his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming\n",
      "down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the\n",
      "shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild\n",
      "eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's\n",
      "outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks\n",
      "still ringing in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\n",
      "so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where\n",
      "he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he\n",
      "was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he\n",
      "must be five floors above there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\n",
      "wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted\n",
      "Section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\n",
      "know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and\n",
      "to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well,\n",
      "they can't be far, we'll catch them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\n",
      "ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor\n",
      "and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak\n",
      "didn't stop him from being solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\n",
      "was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying\n",
      "not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room\n",
      "without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry\n",
      "leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps\n",
      "dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before\n",
      "he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\n",
      "were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper\n",
      "basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that\n",
      "didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone\n",
      "had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\n",
      "frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved\n",
      "around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic\n",
      "fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved\n",
      "nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\n",
      "again. He stepped in front of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\n",
      "whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\n",
      "book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but\n",
      "a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\n",
      "the mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\n",
      "reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his\n",
      "shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,\n",
      "too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's\n",

      "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\n",

      "she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,\n",

      "How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade\n",

      "eating anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\n",

      "And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less\n",

      "who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing\n",
      "alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us\n",
      "neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by\n",

      "\n",

      "wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he\n",
      "couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed\n",

      "their brooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of\n",

      "apart from you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he\n",

      "ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Snape?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped\n",
      "protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape\n",
      "had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\n",
      "how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --\n",
      "except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,\n",
      "Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?\n",
      "Not even one of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we\n",
      "have a window open? I'm boiling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hagrid -- what's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,\n",
      "underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's er...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get\n",
      "a closer look at the egg. \"It must've cost you a fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a\n",
      "few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was\n",
      "quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book\n",
      "from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding\n",
      "for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's\n",
      "all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I\n",
      "em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with\n",
      "chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\n",
      "fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\n",
      "Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n",
      "\"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening\n",
      "after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were\n",
      "getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and\n",
      "Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.\n",
      "He had written only two words: It's hatching.\n",

      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\n",
      "wouldn't hear of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "hatching?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what\n",
      "Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\n",
      "much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\n",
      "Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during\n",
      "morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their\n",
      "lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried\n",
      "through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,\n",
      "looking flushed and excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\n",
      "was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\n",
      "dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought\n",
      "it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge\n",
      "compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,\n",
      "the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\n",
      "the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\n",

      "Malfoy had seen the dragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't,\" said Hagrid. \"He's too little. He'd die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\n",
      "week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing\n",
      "his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There\n",
      "were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\n",

      "\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to\n",

      "The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\n",
      "sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\n",

      "\n",
      "chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of\n",

      "but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little\n",
      "bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when\n",
      "I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to\n",

      "Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this\n",

      "into a sweat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've\n",

      "going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis\n",

      "\n",
      "How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\n",

      "Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\n",

      "strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.\n",
      "He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into\n",
      "the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.\n",

      "say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\n",

      "\n",
      "They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don' worry, it can't've\n",

      "Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a\n",

      "raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was\n",
      "slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing\n",
      "along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few\n",
      "seconds, the sound faded away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There's summat in here that shouldn' be.\"\n",

      "Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I'm armed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\n",
      "man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming\n",
      "chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws\n",
      "dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"\n",

      "\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A bit. Well, that's something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\n",
      "and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter\n",
      "yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\n",
      "sighed again.\n",

      "\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in\n",

      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\n",
      "nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being\n",
      "watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our\n",

      "\n",
      "The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's\n",

      "What was going on? Where were the others?\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were\n",

      "Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid\n",
      "added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin'\n",

      "\n",
      "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\n",
      "walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until\n",
      "the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so\n",
      "thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were\n",
      "splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been\n",
      "thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,\n",
      "through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\n",
      "anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at\n",
      "odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on\n",
      "the dark leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\n",
      "freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....\n",
      "Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the\n",
      "ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood\n",
      "transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head\n",
      "over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded\n",

      "dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward\n",
      "Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as\n",
      "though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He\n",
      "heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over\n",
      "Harry, charging at the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a\n",
      "minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur\n",
      "was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he\n",
      "had white-blond hair and a palomino body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\n",
      "sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar\n",
      "that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid.\n",

      "It will be quicker this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\n",
      "legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\n",
      "clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks\n",
      "heaving and sweaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your\n",
      "back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The\n",
      "quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we\n",
      "are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read\n",
      "what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was\n",

      "Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\n",

      "\n",
      "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had\n",
      "to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not\n",
      "understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that\n",
      "secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,\n",
      "with humans alongside me if I must.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\n",
      "they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from,\n",
      "anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of\n",
      "low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made\n",
      "their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought\n",
      "Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a\n",
      "particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the\n",
      "horn and tail hair in Potions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\n",
      "Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,\n",
      "would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive,\n",
      "even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have\n",
      "slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have\n",
      "but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your\n",
      "lips.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in\n",
      "the moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be\n",
      "cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\n",
      "enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to\n",
      "full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.\n",

      "who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's\n",
      "heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what\n",
      "Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died.\n",
      "Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to\n",

      "exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\n",

      "-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if\n",

      "his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there\n",
      "was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\n",
      "or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron\n",
      "and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea\n",

      "\"What are you three doing inside?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n",

      "Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He\n",
      "received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books\n",

      "\n",

      "\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I don't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But Professor --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They stared at him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around\n",
      "\n",
      "like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor\n",

      "\"Why me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\n",

      "I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\n",
      "Snape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.\n",
      "\"Come on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the\n",
      "door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor\n",
      "McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of\n",

      "Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to\n",
      "the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's\n",

      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was\n",

      "and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said.\n",
      "\n",

      "the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like\n",
      "when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get\n",
      "expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark\n",
      "Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think\n",
      "he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house\n",
      "cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to\n",
      "go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's\n",
      "only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over\n",
      "to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\n",
      "you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He glared at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it\n",
      "back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All -- all three of us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to\n",
      "the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there\n",
      "might be something useful...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in\n",

      "throwing me out after that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\n",
      "Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to\n",
      "Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset\n",
      "by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come\n",
      "across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry\n",
      "and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they\n",
      "were about to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\n",
      "stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He\n",
      "putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\n",
      "given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't\n",
      "feel much like singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran back down to the common room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of\n",
      "us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\n",
      "appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked\n",
      "as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\n",
      "behind his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neville stared at their guilty faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're going out again,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,\n",
      "Neville?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford\n",
      "to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor\n",
      "will be in even more trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the\n",
      "portrait hole. \"I'll -- I'll fight you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot\n",
      "--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don't think you should be\n",
      "breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\n",
      "people!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know\n",
      "what you're doing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm\n",
      "ready!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry turned to Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do something,\" he said desperately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione stepped forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She raised her wand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\n",
      "body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,\n",
      "stiff as a board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he\n",
      "couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so\n",
      "sorry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him\n",
      "and pulled on the invisibility cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a\n",
      "very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked\n",
      "like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping\n",
      "down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.\n",
      "Norris skulking near the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but\n",
      "Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris\n",
      "turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\n",
      "third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that\n",
      "people would trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed\n",
      "his wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are\n",
      "you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had a sudden idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own\n",
      "reasons for being invisible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time\n",
      "and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My\n",
      "mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're\n",
      "invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this\n",
      "place tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air\n",
      "again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he scooted off\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor\n",
      "-- and the door was already ajar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past\n",
      "Fluffy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\n",
      "what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the\n",
      "cloak, I won't need it now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're coming,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry pushed the door open.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of\n",
      "the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it\n",
      "couldn't see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here\n",
      "goes...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but\n",
      "from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew\n",
      "breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and\n",
      "fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\n",
      "crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath\n",
      "as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the\n",
      "door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first,\n",
      "Hermione?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's\n",
      "legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and\n",
      "open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just\n",
      "have to drop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his\n",
      "attention and pointed at himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep\n",
      "this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog\n",
      "growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell\n",
      "back into its deep sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no\n",
      "sign of the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\n",
      "fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to\n",
      "me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\n",
      "Dumbledore, right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See you in a minute, I hope...\n",
      "\n",
      "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\n",
      "down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on\n",
      "something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the\n",
      "gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,\n",
      "which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.\n",
      "Come on, Hermione!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\n",
      "Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must be miles under the school , she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\n",
      "because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\n",
      "snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\n",
      "had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\n",
      "her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\n",
      "off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster\n",
      "the plant wound around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it's\n",
      "Devil's Snare!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled\n",
      "Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his\n",
      "neck. \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\n",
      "curled around his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\n",
      "likes the dark and the damp\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\n",
      "muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\n",
      "used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\n",
      "loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.\n",
      "Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they\n",
      "were able to pull free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\n",
      "joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --\n",
      "'there's no wood,' honestly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the\n",
      "only way forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\n",
      "water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and\n",
      "Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\n",
      "he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'\n",
      "bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad\n",
      "enough...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think it's a ghost?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\n",
      "lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\n",
      "jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the\n",
      "opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if\n",
      "they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll\n",
      "run.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\n",
      "across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\n",
      "him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He\n",
      "pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\n",
      "wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys --\n",
      "look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while\n",
      "the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\n",
      "Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there are hundreds of them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron examined the lock on the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the\n",
      "handle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\n",
      "the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\n",
      "bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\n",
      "catch one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\n",
      "had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's\n",
      "weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large\n",
      "silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and\n",
      "stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\n",
      "-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\n",
      "the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\n",
      "key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,\n",
      "stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right,\n",
      "NOW!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\n",
      "streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\n",
      "with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\n",
      "hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\n",
      "his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment\n",
      "the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\n",
      "battered now that it had been caught twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\n",
      "nodded. He pulled the door open.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as\n",
      "they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\n",
      "astonishing sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\n",
      "chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what\n",
      "looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the\n",
      "white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering\n",
      "white chessmen had no faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across\n",
      "the room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\n",
      "knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the\n",
      "ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight\n",
      "nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This needs thinking about \the said. I suppose we've got to take the\n",
      "place of three of the black pieces....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n",
      "\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at\n",
      "chess --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\n",
      "next to him instead of that castle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\n",
      "knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\n",
      "and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\n",
      "and Hermione took.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\n",
      "\"Yes... look...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\n",
      "sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\n",
      "queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he\n",
      "lay quite still, facedown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to\n",
      "take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\n",
      "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.\n",
      "Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\n",
      "danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white\n",
      "pieces as they had lost black ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me\n",
      "think...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It's the only way... I've got to be taken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take\n",
      "one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate\n",
      "the king, Harry!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ron --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now,\n",
      "don't hang around once you've won.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\n",
      "across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -\n",
      "Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron\n",
      "to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had\n",
      "won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With\n",
      "one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through\n",
      "the door and up the next passageway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if he's --?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do\n",
      "you reckon's next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put\n",
      "charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them\n",
      "alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached another door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry pushed it open.\n",
      "\n",
      "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\n",
      "robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in\n",
      "front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out\n",
      "cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\n",
      "stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't\n",
      "breathe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\n",
      "came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table\n",
      "with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\n",
      "them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At\n",
      "the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.\n",
      "They were trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\n",
      "looked over her shoulder to read it:\n",
      "\n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n",
      "\n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead,\n",
      "\n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead,\n",
      "\n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\n",
      "\n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n",
      "\n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end,\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\n",
      "\n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was\n",
      "smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.\n",
      "A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be\n",
      "stuck in here forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But so will we, won't we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything\n",
      "we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are\n",
      "wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us\n",
      "back through the purple.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how do we know which to drink?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the\n",
      "line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she\n",
      "clapped her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black\n",
      "fire -- toward the Stone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That's hardly one\n",
      "swallow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\n",
      "brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor\n",
      "and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\n",
      "Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while,\n",
      "but I'm no match for him, really.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar.\n",
      "\"I might get lucky again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\n",
      "arms around him.\n",

      "\"Hermione!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.\"\n",

      "\"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important\n",
      "things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle\n",
      "at the end, and shuddered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No -- but it's like ice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\n",
      "down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking\n",

      "Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he\n",

      "himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\n",
      "seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in\n",
      "front of the mirror, and opened them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\n",
      "later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and\n",
      "pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its\n",
      "pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his\n",
      "real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\n",

      "Harry screwed up his courage.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Quirrell cursed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\n",
      "Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\n",

      "\"He lies... He lies...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did\n",

      "The high voice spoke again.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have strength enough... for this....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't\n",
      "move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\n",
      "unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's\n",
      "head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the\n",
      "spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there\n",
      "should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most\n",
      "terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red\n",
      "eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I\n",
      "have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always\n",
      "been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn\n",
      "blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell\n",
      "drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,\n",
      "I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give\n",
      "me that Stone in your pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He\n",
      "stumbled backward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join\n",
      "me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging\n",
      "me for mercy...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\n",
      "him. The evil face was now smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your\n",
      "parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a\n",
      "courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying\n",
      "to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have\n",

      "\"NEVER!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"\n",

      "once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as\n",
      "though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his\n",
      "might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head\n",
      "lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and\n",
      "saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering\n",
      "before his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,\n",
      "knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands\n",
      "around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,\n",
      "yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\n",
      "of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see\n",
      "they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by\n",
      "instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"AAAARGH!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\n",
      "Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible\n",
      "pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough\n",
      "pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as\n",
      "tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the\n",
      "pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only\n",
      "hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM!\n",
      "KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry!\n",
      "Harry!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to\n",
      "catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\n",
      "strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view\n",
      "above him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he\n",

      "quick --\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\n",
      "hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next\n",
      "to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What\n",
      "happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\n",
      "complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your\n",
      "friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\n",
      "send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam\n",

      "\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it\n",

      "day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great\n",
      "adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As\n",
      "much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings\n",
      "would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\n",
      "choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\n",
      "there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\n",
      "for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.\n",
      "He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers\n",
      "as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his\n",
      "return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\n",
      "fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed\n",
      "again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\n",

      "full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\n",

      "\n",
      "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\n",

      "\n",
      "It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\n",
      "strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:\n",
      "Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a\n",
      "very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\n",
      "told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to\n",
      "the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\n",

      "less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty\n",
      "good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just\n",
      "taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n",

      "Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\n",
      "indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,\n",
      "took one look at him, and burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.\n",

      "found out even if you hadn't told him.\"\n",

      "got yeh this...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\n",
      "curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer\n",

      "\n",
      "Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He\n",
      "had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving\n",
      "him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked\n",
      "out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's\n",
      "winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner\n",
      "showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started\n",
      "talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\n",
      "at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\n",
      "standing up to look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\n",

      "Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred\n",

      "\n",
      "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\n",

      "sickening sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\n",
      "events must be taken into account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\n",
      "award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars\n",
      "overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other\n",
      "prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past\n",
      "McGonagall's giant chess set!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At last there was silence again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\n",
      "face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\n",
      "burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside\n",
      "themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry\n",
      "Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\n",
      "and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves\n",
      "hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points\n",
      "-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if\n",
      "only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\n",
      "great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to\n",
      "stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\n",
      "Longbottom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\n",
      "sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted\n",
      "from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and\n",
      "cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people\n",
      "hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.\n",
      "Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who\n",
      "couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the\n",
      "Body-Bind Curse put on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\n",
      "Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we\n",
      "need a little change of decoration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\n",
      "and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a\n",
      "towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor\n",
      "McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye\n",
      "and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed\n",
      "one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back\n",
      "to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at\n",
      "Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\n",
      "never, ever forget tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but\n",
      "come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good\n",
      "marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even\n",
      "Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his\n",
      "abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid\n",
      "as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a\n",
      "shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\n",

      "holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred\n",
