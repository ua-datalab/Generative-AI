Declaration/Structure:
I am pasting below two vb.net files.

The first file, called metaDataFile , earmarked below with "------start of constants and definitions file---"  contains the  metadata of the datatypes and the syntax. 

Second file, called {input_class_name}, earmarked below with "---start of actual class file for {input_class_name}----"  shows a class for a {input_class_name} created using the metadata in metaDataFile.  

For example, inside {input_class_name}, understand within this construct: "Public Const CmintColorUid_Length As Integer = clsGlobalEnum.enumFieldLength.eLength4"  eLength4 as length of a field with datalength 4. eLength4 is in turn taken from the metaDataFile. 


Definition/Information:
Fields for {output_class_name} class are as follows
Field name is BuyerId ,  datatype is Integer, datalength 4
Field name is BuyerName . datatype is varwchar , datalength 100
Field name is Address1 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50
Field name is Address2 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50
Field name is Address3 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50
Field name is Address4 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50
Field name is Phone1 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25
Field name is Phone2 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25
Field name is MobilePhone , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25


Functionality:
You should refer these files in the following order while executing the command below.
1) first read the metaDataFile
2) follow the region hierarchy in {input_class_name}
3) Then only use your internal pre-trained knowledge for defining anything.

Now execute the following commands:
1) Create a similar vb.net class but instead this time for a {output_class_name} class. 
2) Use metaDataFile as reference.
3) do not remove the comments given in the {input_class_name}- rather replicate it as is with the required modifications.
4) make sure intendation in the {output_class_name} class is matched exactly like in the input class, {input_class_name}, i.e use vbTab for indentation (as per the definition of tab given in vb.net coding standards).
5) when you create "Variable for Fields" create mlngColorUid As String
6) make sure you keep the casing (e.g. uppercase, camel case) of the field names exactly as that of {input_class_name}. 
7) make sure inline spacing of every single code line in the {output_class_name} class is matched exactly like in the input class, {input_class_name}. For example note that in this line: "Private mobjSolutionBO As clsSolutionBO'Default Design"
there is no space between "clsSolutionBO" and "'Default Design"
