Declaration/Structure:
I am pasting below two vb.net files.


The first file, called metaDataFile , earmarked below with "------start of constants and definitions file---"  contains the  metadata of the datatypes and the syntax. 


second file, called frmBuyerGUI, earmarked below with "---start of actual class file for frmBuyerGUI----"  shows the code for frmBuyerGUI.


Definition/Information:

Fields for buyer class are as follows:
Field name is BuyerId 
Field name is BuyerName 
Field name is Address1 
Field name is Address2 
Field name is Address3 
Field name is Address4 
Field name is Phone1 
Field name is Phone2 
Field name is MobilePhone 



Fields for frmColorGUI code is as follows:
Field name is colorUid 
Field name is colorcode
Field name is colorname




Functionality:
You should refer these files in the following order while executing the command below:
- first read the metaDataFile
- second read the frmBuyerGUI
- then follow the region hierarchy in frmBuyerGUI
- Then only use your internal pre-trained knowledge for defining anything.



Now execute the following commands:
1) Create a similar vb.net code but instead this time for a frmColorGUI code. 

2) do not remove the comments given in the frmBuyerGUI- rather replicate it as is with the required modifications.

3) make sure intendation in the frmColorGUI output code is matched exactly like in the input code, frmBuyerGUI, i.e use vbTab for indentation (as per the definition of tab given in vb.net coding standards).

4) make sure you keep the casing (e.g. uppercase, camel case) of the field names exactly as that of frmBuyerGUI. 

5) make sure inline spacing of every single code line in the output class is matched exactly like in the input class, frmBuyerGUI.
