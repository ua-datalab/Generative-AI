'Declaration/Structure:\nI am pasting below two vb.net files.\n\nThe first file, called metaDataFile , earmarked below with "------start of constants and definitions file---"  contains the  metadata of the datatypes and the syntax. \n\nSecond file, called clsColor, earmarked below with "---start of actual class file for clsColor----"  shows a class for a clsColor created using the metadata in metaDataFile.  \n\nFor example, inside clsColor, understand within this construct: "Public Const CmintColorUid_Length As Integer = clsGlobalEnum.enumFieldLength.eLength4"  eLength4 as length of a field with datalength 4. eLength4 is in turn taken from the metaDataFile. \n\n\nDefinition/Information:\nFields for clsBuyer class are as follows\nField name is BuyerId ,  datatype is Integer, datalength 4\nField name is BuyerName . datatype is varwchar , datalength 100\nField name is Address1 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50\nField name is Address2 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50\nField name is Address3 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50\nField name is Address4 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 50\nField name is Phone1 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25\nField name is Phone2 , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25\nField name is MobilePhone , datatype is varWChar ,  datalength 25\n\n\nFunctionality:\nYou should refer these files in the following order while executing the command below.\n1) first read the metaDataFile\n2) follow the region hierarchy in clsColor\n3) Then only use your internal pre-trained knowledge for defining anything.\n\nNow execute the following commands:\n1) Create a similar vb.net class but instead this time for a clsBuyer class. \n2) Use metaDataFile as reference.\n3) do not remove the comments given in the clsColor- rather replicate it as is with the required modifications.\n4) make sure intendation in the clsBuyer class is matched exactly like in the input class, clsColor, i.e use vbTab for indentation (as per the definition of tab given in vb.net coding standards).\n5) when you create "Variable for Fields" create mlngColorUid As String\n6) make sure you keep the casing (e.g. uppercase, camel case) of the field names exactly as that of clsColor. \n7) make sure inline spacing of every single code line in the clsBuyer class is matched exactly like in the input class, clsColor. For example note that in this line: "Private mobjSolutionBO As clsSolutionBO\'Default Design"\nthere is no space between "clsSolutionBO" and "\'Default Design"\n\n\n\n\n\n------start of constants and
