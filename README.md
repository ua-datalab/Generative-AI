## Workshop: Navigating the Modern AI Landscape: RAG, Tool-Use, and Agents

### Topic Overview

This eight-session workshop is tailored for graduate students eager to move beyond foundational AI concepts and master the practical application of modern Large Language Model (LLM) operations and agentic systems. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into research and industry, this series focuses on equipping participants with the skills to deploy, customize, and extend these powerful tools. We'll begin by exploring how to **run LLMs locally** using tools like Ollama and LM Studio, fostering hands-on experience and an understanding of resource management. The workshop will also introduce platforms like **AI VERDE**, which facilitate access to a variety of open-source LLMs within institutional or research settings.

A significant portion of the series is dedicated to advanced LLM applications. Participants will learn to implement **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, enabling LLMs to access and utilize external, up-to-date knowledge bases, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy (Lewis et al., 2020). We will then explore **tool calling**, a mechanism that allows LLMs to interact with external software and APIs, and a practical application of this in **text-to-SQL code generation**.

The workshop culminates in an exploration of **agentic systems**, where LLMs are empowered to reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. We'll also touch upon emerging standards and SDKs, such as Anthropic's approaches to context management with the **Claude SDK**, and practical data integration techniques using **Google Firebase** to support AI applications. Throughout the series, interdisciplinary use-cases will be highlighted, demonstrating how these advanced AI skills can enhance research, automate complex workflows, and develop innovative solutions across diverse academic fields.
